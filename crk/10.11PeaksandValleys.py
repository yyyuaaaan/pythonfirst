# PeaksandValleys:Inanarrayofintegers,a"peak"isanelementwhichisgreaterthanorequalto the adjacent integers
# and a 'valley' is an element which is less than or equal to the adjacent integers.
# For example, in the array {5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6}, {8, 6} are peaks and {5, 2} are valleys.
#  Given an array of integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.
