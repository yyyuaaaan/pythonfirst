"""
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 3 x 7 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.


 1. Use formula C(x,t) = t!/(x!*(t-x)!) (x should be large for calculation).
 2. Dynamic programming. UP(i,j) = UP(i-1,j) + UP(i,j-1).

   int uniquePaths_2(int m, int n) {
        int dp[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            dp[0][j] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];

        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
